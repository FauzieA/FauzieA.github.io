                <h2>Research: Women Are Better Leaders During a Crisis</h2>
                <h3>by Jack Zenger and Joseph Folkman</h3>
                <p>
                    There has been a lot said about how women have done a better job leading during the Covid-19 crisis than men. According to an analysis of 360-degree assessments conducted between March and June of this year, women were rated by those who work with them as more effective.The gap between men and women in the pandemic is even larger than previously measured, possibly indicating that women tend to perform better in a crisis. In fact, women were rated more positively on 13 of the 19 competencies that comprise overall leadership effectiveness in the authors’ assessment.

                <h2>War on women </h2>
                <h3>Proportion of women killed in armed conflicts doubles in 2023</h3>
                <p>
                    UN paints dire picture of women in war: Despite rising conflict less than 10 per cent of negotiators in peace processes in 2023 were women.
                    New York, 22 October - The effects of war and conflict on women and girls are worsening. In 2023, the proportion of women killed in armed conflicts doubled compared to 2022. Four out of every ten people who died as a result of conflict in 2023 were women. UN-verified cases of conflict-related sexual violence increased by 50 per cent.

                    "This war has irreversibly changed my life. We have been displaced repeatedly, losing my education, my friends. The fear we live with is beyond words.”

Those are the words of Leen Nahal, who at the age of 14 has endured five wars in Gaza and been repeatedly displaced.

                <h2>Empowering women</h2>
                <h3>The OIC’s Women’s Development Organization is ensuring that Muslim women are finally receiving their right to equality</h3>
                <p>
                    Out of the 1.6 billion Muslims in the world today, over half are women. However, the ever rising presence and prominence of women in Islamic countries hasn’t exactly resulted in a corresponding ascension of women’s rights. It is a fact that, on average, women continue to earn less than men for the same work, while nearly two thirds of the world’s 700 million illiterate adults are female.
